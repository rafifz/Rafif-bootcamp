### Value Parameter.
- Value parameters are the most common type of parameters. They pass a copy of the argument to the method. The original argument is not affected by the method. This is also known as pass by value.

### Ref Parameter
- Reference parameters are also known as pass by reference. They pass the actual reference of the argument to the method. If the method changes the reference, the original argument will also be changed.

### In Parameter 
- In parameters are used with reference parameters. They allow you to pass a reference to the argument but prevent the method from changing the reference. This ensures that the original argument will not be affected by the method.

### Out Parameter
- Out parameters are used with reference parameters. They allow you to pass a reference to the argument and also enable the method to change the reference. The method guarantees that the argument will be assigned a value before the method returns.
